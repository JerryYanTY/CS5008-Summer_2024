## Qn1 ##

- A ring buffer allows enqueues and dequeues (or insertion and deletion) to be done in constant time (O(1)). It also reduces memory consumption. It should be used when we have limited memory resources, or when we what to achieve better time complexity with arrays.


## Qn2 ##

- Stacks should be used when we want the items to be in a specific LIFO order.
